We're really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition. 👏

## Instructions

These steps will guide you through contributing to this project:

- Fork the repo
- Clone it and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vortesnail/qier-progress
npm install
```

- Check demo
```bash
npm run dev
```

- 🚑 Urgent help
I am too busy and have limited energy, I will be appreciated if someone can help write the test of the `index.spec.ts` file, it would be better.🙏

Keep in mind that after running `npm install` the git repo is reset. So a good way to cope with this is to have a copy of the folder to push the changes, and the other to try them.

Make and commit your changes. Make sure the commands `npm run test:prod` and `npm run build` are working.

Finally send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/vortesnail/qier-progress/compare?expand=1) with a clear list of what you've done (read more [about pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)). Make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
